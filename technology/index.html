                 In human-robot collaboration, the robot assists the human
                 operator. This means: The machine does not replace the
                 human, but complements his capabilities and relieves him of
                 arduous tasks. These can include overhead work, for
                 example, or the lifting of heavy loads. Autonomous,
                 collaborative robots are also used to supply production
